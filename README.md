## FluoSim

FluoSim is an open source interactive software that allows real time simulation 
of membrane protein dynamics in live-cell imaging (SPT, FRAP, PAF, and FCS) and super-resolution microscopy.
FluoSim software (v1.0) has been released together with the following article: [FluoSim: simulator of single molecule dynamics for fluorescence live-cell and super-resolution imaging of membrane proteins](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-75814-y).

FluoSim can be downloaded directly from the Scientific Reports article webpage ([Supplementary Information 4](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-75814-y#Sec22)) or from the release section of this repository. 

FluoSim's user-manual can be downloaded from the Scientific Reports article webpage ([Supplementary Information 1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-75814-y#Sec22)) or can be found in the installation folder (FluoSim/Resources/Documentation/FluoSim - UserManual.pdf).
